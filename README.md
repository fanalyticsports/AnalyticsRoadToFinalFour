# AnalyticsRoadToFinalFour
AnalyticsRoadToTheFinalFour 2017

Check out our entry for the Tableau Iron Viz competition and up vote if you like it. Our goal was to design something that looked at the proximity of opponents in the NCAA Final Four as part of our #AnalyticsRoadToTheFinalFour. It's a combination of a variety of Business Intelligence tools & solutions from AWS, Python, R, Atom, GeoJSon, and Tableau. All positioned in one dashboard to see how your team have seeded and traveled throughout the years. Feel free to check out your team and enjoy.
